## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration Options

### Date Range Settings
```javascript
// Use specific dates
startDate: '2025-01-01',  // YYYY-MM-DD format
endDate: '2025-01-31',

// Or use relative dates
startDate: getDateDaysAgo(30),  // 30 days ago
endDate: getDateDaysAgo(0),     // Today
```

### Filter Options (JQL Script Only)
```javascript
// Filter worklogs by date (even if issue was created earlier)
dateFilter: {
  enabled: true,
  startDate: '2025-09-01',
  endDate: '2025-10-16'
},

// Filter worklogs by specific people
authorFilter: {
  enabled: true,
  authorEmails: ['user1@company.com', 'user2@company.com']
}
```

### Performance Settings (for large teams)
```javascript
// For teams with 50+ people or 2000+ tickets
enableBatchProcessing: true,
batchSize: 200,           // Process 200 issues at a time
batchDelayMs: 1000,       // Wait 1 second between batches
maxIssuesToProcess: 5000, // Safety limit
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" or "401 Unauthorized"
- Double-check your email and API token are correct
- Make sure your API token hasn't expired
- Verify your JIRA base URL is correct

### "User not found" or "Group not found"
- Check the spelling of email addresses or group names
- Group names are case-sensitive
- Make sure the person has access to JIRA

### "No issues found" or "No worklogs found"
- Try expanding your date range
- Check if the issues actually have worklogs in that time period
- For JQL queries, test your query in JIRA's issue search first

### Script runs but Excel file is empty
- The date range might not match when work was actually logged
- Team members might not have logged time in that period
- Check the console output for filtering information

### "Rate limit exceeded"
- The script will automatically retry, just wait
- For large teams, enable batch processing in the config
- Consider running during off-peak hours

### "Module not found" errors
- Make sure you ran `npm install node-fetch xlsx readline`
- Try running as Administrator
- Restart your command prompt after installing Node.js
